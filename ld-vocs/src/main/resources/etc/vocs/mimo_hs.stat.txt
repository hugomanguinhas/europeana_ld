	  2 (000%): The air itself is the vibrator in the primary sense. The standing waves are significantly confined within the instrument itself. A narrow duct directs the air stream against the sharp edge of a lateral orifice. The duct is outside the wall of the flute; this group includes flutes with the duct chamfered in the wall under a ring-like sleeve and other similar arrangements.@en
	  2 (000%): The air itself is the vibrator in the primary sense. The standing waves are significantly confined within the instrument itself. The column of air is made to vibrate by the intermittent access of an air stream produced by means of lamellae. The single pipe has a reed of paired lamellae (usually a flattened stem), which periodically open and close, controlling the flow of air. The single pipe has a conical bore with keys. Each pipe in the set of double-reed pipes has a reed of paired lamellae (usually a flattened stem), which periodically open and close, controlling the flow of air and a conical bore. In each single-reed pipe in the set of two or more, the column of air is made to vibrate by the intermittent access of an air stream produced by means of a [single] 'reed' consisting of a lamella which periodically opens and closes an aperture, controlling the flow of air. The instrument is tuned by altering the lengths of the air columns. With flexible air reservoir.@en
